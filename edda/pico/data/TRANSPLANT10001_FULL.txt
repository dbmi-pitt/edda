AB  - Outcomes following renal and simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplants have improved signicantly due to better surgical techniques and improved modalities of antirejection therapy. However, infection remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The use of new modalities of immunosuppression and routine use of antimicrobial prophylaxis has changed the pattern of infections post-transplantation. Cytomegalovirus remains a significant problem and BK virus has emerged as an important pathogen. New antimicrobial agents are now available to treat infection, however, antimicrobial resistance remains a concern. (copyright) Future Drugs Ltd. All rights reserved.
